# Stock-Price-Prediction
This project aims to forecast stock prices using historical data, implementing time-series analysis and machine-learning models. The goal is to analyze market trends and provide actionable insights for investors.

1. Features of the Dataset
Date: Trading date.
Open: The opening price of the stock.
Close: The closing price of the stock.
High: Highest price during the trading day.
Low: Lowest price during the trading day.
Volume: Number of shares traded.
Workflow

2. Exploratory Data Analysis:
Time-series analysis to identify trends and seasonality.
Visualization of historical stock price patterns.

3. Data Preprocessing:
Handling missing values and outliers.
Feature scaling for improved model performance.

4. Model Development:
ARIMA for time-series forecasting.
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks for deep learning-based predictions.
Evaluation using metrics like RMSE and MAPE.

5. Results:
Comparison of traditional and deep learning approaches to stock price forecasting.
